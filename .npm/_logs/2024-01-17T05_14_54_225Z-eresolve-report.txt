# npm resolution error report

While resolving: crypto-tracker@0.1.0
Found: react@17.0.2
node_modules/react
  react@"^17.0.2" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^0.14.0 || ^15.0.0 || ^16.0.0-0" from react-html-parser@2.0.2
node_modules/react-html-parser
  react-html-parser@"2.0.2" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
